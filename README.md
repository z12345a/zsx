# A simple guide to converting data into charts

This guide will show you how to set up and run a Python program that can convert data into charts. We will use Pandas and Matplotlib, two popular Python libraries, to process data and create charts。

## Step 1: Install the necessary libraries

Enter the following command in the terminal or command line to install PyQt5,Qt-Material,PyEcharts,Pandas and Python3 libraries:
```
pip install PyQt5
pip install Qt-Material
pip install PyEcharts
pip install Pandas
pip install Python3
```

##Step 2: Run the program

You can save the above code as a Python script and run it on the terminal or command line, or place it in a Jupyter Notebook or other interactive environment.
If you save the code as a file 'chart. py', you can run it by entering the following command on the terminal or command line:
```
python chart.py
```
